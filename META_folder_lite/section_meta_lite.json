Such protection can even prevent flame propagation of Hydrogen-air mixture (having lowest experimental safe gap valve MESG = 0.29 mm) if granule size smaller than 1 mm & a layer thickness of 10 mm is used as filling material.",
    "content": "As per the Indian standards the explosive gases are classified under two broad categories viz, Group I–Methane\nGroup II is sub divided into three types, viz IIA, IIB, IIC\nIIA\trepresents Propane\nIIB\trepresents Ethylene\nIIC\trepresents Acetylene\nIB+H2\trepresent Ethylene + Hydrogen\n\nSince areas coming under the Petroleum Rules, 2002 will have presence of hydrocarbons consisting of Carbon chain of C2 and above, the equipment to be used should be appropriate to IIA & IIB classification. However, if the electric apparatus is to find application in petroleum refineries where presence of hydrogen cannot be ruled out, approval under Group IIC would be required in such case.\n",
